## Install dependencies 
1. Ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer
2. Install `expo go` app on your phone
3. Navigate to the *leakcheck* folder and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo start (or npm start)
   ```
and press button for your prefered device/emulator (`w` for web would be the simplest probably).
You can also try running it directly `npm start [web/Android/etc]`

   In case you use wsl:
   ```bash
   npx expo start --tunnel
   ```
